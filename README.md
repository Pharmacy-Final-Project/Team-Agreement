## Conflict Plan  
See where conflict happen, make sure to make pull before start working

Send the problem on slack and we will explain to him that each person in the team is an asset and can contribute, we should all work together to reach our project's goal

We should distribute tasks among us, each member know his/her tasks, so in this way we avoid one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute

Try to divide tasks according to each member experience and skills

In a respectful way you should contribute with us because this project at the end for us either in the course or coming carrier

Ask team leader to judge, then we can avoid this to happen
